  This is a custom component that you can include in your template.
  You can define any HTML you like and include it with your theme's templates
  using <code>include</code>.

  The basic-ng theme also comes with several components that you can re-use.
  <a href="https://github.com/pradyunsg/sphinx-basic-ng/tree/main/src/sphinx_basic_ng/theme/basic-ng/components">here's a list of them</a>.
  
  For example, below we'll include the component <code>breadcrumbs.html</code>
  which will display breadcrumbs for a page:

  {% include "components/edit-this-page.html" %}
