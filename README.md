# sphinx-basic-ng-template

This is a WIP template repository to prototype what it looks like to sub-theme the sphinx-basic-ng theme.

Goals of this template:

- Utilize a python-only stack
- Show off some nice workflows for SCSS and JS compilation
- Only utilize the workflows that 80% of themes might be interested in
- Be copyable for other theme authors that want to use this as a starting point
- Understand where sphinx-basic-ng UX could be improved
